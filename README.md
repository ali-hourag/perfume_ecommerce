## About

This is my first React project with TypeScript done by me, Ali Hourag. 
<br/>
* It uses different libraries like react-hook-form for form validation.
* React-hot-toast has been implemented for dinamic notifications.
* React-icons library has been used for icon importation.
* React-router-dom has been very helpful for routing.
* Mobile first design!

## Setup
If you want run it directly from code you will need to open 2 terminals and run the following commands on each one:
- npm run server to run the simple json data on http://localhost:3000
- npm run dev to run the project and open it through the localhost
<br/>
Afterwards, right click on the explorer and select mobile device, since it is optimized for mobile devices!
